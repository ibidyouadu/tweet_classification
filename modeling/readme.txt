The notebooks are ready to be run. You may want to run the BERT code on a cloud platform. Both notebooks were originally written on Google colab, so they can easily be integrated there.  Feel free to use the notebooks to analyze:

- labeling irma tweets by disaster-relatedness, damage-relatedness, and sentiment
- labeling the harvey tweets

The code should be able to run right off the bat for irma analyses, just change the training/testing labels accordingly. For harvey analyses, make sure to modify the keyword information.

rf_count_vectorizer_parameter_tuning.txt may be of limited use. Could provide some insight on parameters, but otherwise was just used by me to keep track of good and bad parameters. It does have the finalized numerical results as recorded in the documentation, however.
