keywords with no tweets: i69, i610, pwy, street, twy


regarding some keywords with high num_twt but little to no tweeets:
'street' filter has 1292 tweets and 'airport' has 1629 filtered tweets, yet 'street' came up with an empty spreadsheet and 'airport' came up with 1 twt. This is because the way the number of twt samples was determined was to take the square of the score and multiply by 100, then take the int() of that. So 'airport' at a score of 10% will get int(100 * 0.1^2) = int(1) = 1 tweet, while 'street' with a score of 5% gets int(100 * 0.05^2) = int(0.5) = 0 tweets. Thus this sampling method effectively elminates keywords with a score below 10%. 'parkway' and 'belt8' are an exception because of another layer on the sampling method: if the keyword filter returns less than 100 tweets, then those tweets are the sample
