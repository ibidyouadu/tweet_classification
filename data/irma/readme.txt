the most important file here is irma_power_tweets.csv. This has been used the most in modelling and given the most care. If you want to see the tweets returned by individual keywords in the keyword filtering, consult the data_by_keyword folder

the plots folder contains, well, plots. But it also has the timeseries data to make those plots, which all come from irma_power_tweets.csv anyway

the scoring folder has old information that was used early on in the scoring methodology. not very useful now but consult if you want to understand the scoring methodology more

*** Use caution before using anything in this folder for analysis (except the irma_power_tweets.csv); all the stuff in this folder should be redone, since they were based off a data set with 2000 tweets. Since then, 340 more tweets were added. So the information here is not wrong, just outdated
