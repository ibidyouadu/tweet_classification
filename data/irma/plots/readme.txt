this folder contains what you expect: plots. the subfolders are for different quantities being plotted. miami-dade folder is for specific examples, used in a weekly report, presentation, and documentation.

the timeseries folder has the raw data being plotted in the other folders
some plots are messed up for reason I'm not sure at the time of writing (May 10 2020). I have these plots here for archival purposes but I would look closely before using these plots for analysis.
